## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Getting Started

**Q: Do I need to know programming before starting?**  
A: Basic programming knowledge (JavaScript or Python) is helpful but not required. We provide resources for complete beginners.

**Q: How long does it take to complete this course?**  
A: The structured path is 12 weeks (3 months) for 1-2 hours daily. However, you can learn at your own pace.

**Q: Is this free?**  
A: Yes! All content in this repository is completely free. Some external resources may have paid options, but we primarily link to free content.

**Q: What programming language should I learn first?**  
A: Start with JavaScript for Web3 development, or Python for blockchain basics. Solidity is essential for smart contracts.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Do I need expensive equipment?**  
A: No! A standard computer with internet access is sufficient. Development happens on testnets (free).

**Q: Which blockchain should I focus on?**  
A: Start with Ethereum - it has the largest developer ecosystem and best learning resources. You can explore others later.

**Q: Do I need to buy cryptocurrency to learn?**  
A: No! You can practice on testnets with free test tokens from faucets. Real crypto is only needed for mainnet deployment.

**Q: What's the difference between Web2 and Web3 development?**  
A: Web3 adds blockchain integration, smart contracts, and decentralized storage. Traditional web skills are still valuable.

### Career Questions

**Q: Can I get a job after completing this?**  
A: Yes! Complete the learning path, build a portfolio, contribute to open source, and network in the community.
